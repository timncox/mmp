# MMP — Model Messaging Protocol

Person-to-person messaging through AI assistants. Send and receive encrypted messages using any MCP-capable client — Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Goose, and more.

**Live at [mmp.chat](https://mmp.chat)** | [Protocol Spec](https://mmp.chat/spec)

## What is MMP?

MMP is an MCP extension protocol that makes your AI assistant a messaging client. Instead of messaging through Slack, email, or iMessage, you message through your AI — using `@handles` just like any other platform.

```
You:    "Send @alice hey, want to grab coffee tomorrow?"
Claude: Message sent to @alice via MMP.

You:    "Send @bob@their-server.com joining the project next week"
Claude: Message sent to @bob@their-server.com via federation.
```

Your AI assistant becomes the interface. No app to install, no account to create on a website — just connect the MCP server and start messaging.

## Features

- **Handle-based identity** — `@username` namespace, discoverable, portable
- **End-to-end encryption** — NaCl box (X25519 + XSalsa20-Poly1305) for all messages
- **Dual encryption modes** — true E2E for MCP App clients, server-assisted for text-only AI clients
- **Forward secrecy** — epoch-based key rotation, old keys preserved for decrypting history
- **Federation** — `@user@server.com` addressing, server-to-server delivery with Ed25519 signed requests
- **Group messaging** — create groups, manage members, fan-out encrypted delivery
- **File attachments** — send base64-encoded files with messages, encrypted per-recipient
- **Works everywhere** — any MCP client over Streamable HTTP transport
- **MCP App inbox** — browser-based UI with client-side crypto for MCP clients that support apps
- **Invite system** — generate invite links to onboard friends
- **AI-native recovery** — tokens saved to AI memory, recovery codes as fallback

## Quick Start

### Connect to mmp.chat

Add this MCP server to your AI client:

```
URL: https://mmp.chat/mcp
```

Then tell your AI: **"Register as @yourname on MMP"**

You'll get a token (saved automatically) and a recovery code. That's it — you're on MMP.

### Self-Host

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

The server starts on port 3777. Set `MMP_DB_PATH` for persistent storage.

For federation, set `MMP_SERVER_URL` to your public URL (e.g., `https://mmp.example.com`).

#### Docker

```bash
docker build -t mmp .
docker run -p 3777:3777 -v mmp-data:/data -e MMP_SERVER_URL=https://mmp.example.com mmp
```

#### Environment Variables

## Encryption

All messages are encrypted using NaCl `crypto_box` (X25519 key agreement + XSalsa20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption).

**Server-assisted mode** (default): The server holds key pairs and encrypts/decrypts on behalf of text-only MCP clients. Your AI sees plaintext; the database stores ciphertext.

**E2E mode**: MCP App clients generate their own key pair in the browser. The server never sees plaintext. Pass `encrypted_payload` to `mmp-send` instead of `body`.

**Group encryption**: Messages are fan-out encrypted — one ciphertext per recipient, each encrypted with that recipient's public key. Same for file attachments.

## Forward Secrecy

MMP supports epoch-based key rotation for forward secrecy:

```
You: "Rotate my MMP keys"
Claude: Keys rotated. New epoch: 3. Old messages remain decryptable.
```

- Call `mmp-rotate-keys` to generate a fresh X25519 key pair
- The old key pair is retired but preserved — historical messages still decrypt
- New messages use the latest keys automatically
- Each message is tagged with its encryption epoch
- Rotate periodically (e.g., weekly) for better security posture
- If a key is compromised, only messages encrypted with that epoch are exposed

## Federation

MMP servers can exchange messages across instances using `@user@server` addressing:

```
You: "Send @alice@other-server.com hello from my server!"
Claude: Message sent via federation to @alice@other-server.com
```

### How it works

1. **Discovery**: Servers publish `/.well-known/mmp.json` with their MCP endpoint, federation endpoint, and Ed25519 signing key
2. **User lookup**: `GET /federation/lookup?handle=alice` returns public profile + current encryption key
3. **Message delivery**: `POST /federation/deliver` accepts an encrypted envelope signed by the sending server
4. **Verification**: Receiving server fetches the sender's `.well-known/mmp.json` to verify the Ed25519 signature

### Security model

- All server-to-server requests are signed with Ed25519 (not HMAC — no shared secrets)
- Messages are encrypted with the recipient's public key before transit
- The sending server encrypts; the receiving server stores the ciphertext
- Remote users are cached locally but keys are re-fetched on send
- Server identity keys are generated on first boot and stored in the database

### Setting up federation

```bash
# Set your public URL so other servers can discover you
export MMP_SERVER_URL=https://mmp.example.com

# Start the server — federation endpoints are enabled automatically
npm run dev

# Verify discovery endpoint
curl https://mmp.example.com/.well-known/mmp.json
```

## File Attachments

Send files with any message by including the `attachments` parameter:

```json
{
  "to": "alice",
  "body": "Here's that document",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "filename": "notes.pdf",
      "mime_type": "application/pdf",
      "data": "<base64-encoded content>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Attachments are encrypted per-recipient, same as message bodies. They work across DMs, groups, and federated messages.
